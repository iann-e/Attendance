# PHP & Bootstrap Salon Time-in/Time-out

Welcome 


This system could be used for a number of different applications and easily integrated into any projects you may be thinking of creating.  

I have used PHP PDO, JS, HTML, CSS to create this system.  The basic functions are to: 
<ul>
<li>Create a user (Register)</li>
<li>Login a user</li> 
<li>Reset a users password</li> 
<li>Show a basic profile of the logged in user.</li>  
<li>Enabled basic profile editing (username & email address).</li>
</ul>
